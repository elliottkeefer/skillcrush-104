			<h4>If it were easy everyone would do it</h4>
			<p>So it's ok to be confused.</p>

			<p>Embrace the opportunity to learn something new.<br> 
            Resist the urge to throw your laptop through the kitchen window.<br>
            The difference between good and great is mental willpower.</p>

			<h4>Write that $h*t down!</h4>
			<p>You are going to learn a lot. Every time you fix a harassing float or learn a new technique or cool variable write it down. Believe me, next time you come across that you will thank yourself.</p>

            <h4>Get your layups</h4>
            <p>In order to stay motivated you need to succeed. To succeed you have to keep practicing the things you already know how to do. Keep adding new things as you learn them and repeat them. One day you will wake up and realize you're a developer.</p>
